# quack - R tools for UQ and calibration

### Description 

The `quack` package contains several tools for UQ and Bayesian model calibration, with an emphasis on inference for physical parameters in complex physical systems. Many of the tools found in this package are implementations of the ideas found [here](https://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1165&=&context=math_etds&=&sei-redir=1&referer=https%253A%252F%252Fscholar.google.com%252Fscholar%253Fhl%253Den%2526as_sdt%253D0%25252C32%2526q%253DKellin%252BRumsey%252Bphysical%252Bparameters%2526btnG%253D#search=%22Kellin%20Rumsey%20physical%20parameters%22)

### Note (7/17/23)
The R package `MHadaptive` has been removed from CRAN. As of 7/17/2023, in order to install the `quack` package, users will first need to install `MHadaptive` from the Archive as 

```{R, eval=FALSE}
#install.packages("devtools")
link <- "https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/MHadaptive/MHadaptive_1.1-8.tar.gz"
devtools::install_url(link)
```

## Installation

To install the `quack` package, type

```{R, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("knrumsey/quack")
```

## Tools

See [manual](https://github.com/knrumsey/quack/blob/master/quack_0.0.0.9000.pdf) for details. 

  - [**Moment penalization**](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/19M1283707?casa_token=javZzkQnG4oAAAAA:NqF-i_Wpuz5I8j0IHYK-j-q4QzoJr04ohxO1PBMHLwKE640bTAD1MsalHKtFBu1-VTsuu4sR): functions for the moment penalization (MP) prior, which are useful for improving identifiability and reducing bias when a physical system contains a set of nuisance parameters which can be viewed as iid samples from a specified distribution. Also contains methods for computing the probability of prior coherency, a useful diagnostic tool. 
  - **Emulating the conditional posterior**: A fast approach for approximating the [cut distribution](https://idp.springer.com/authorize/casa?redirect_uri=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-014-9503-z&casa_token=K78vRWO3qrQAAAAA:12SChC4sxODP5fp0NYdGSQ-1YybCxPndiT6JZb_NXdKtVlf3-eRa87JvfULTvZs1D30yMOJkWZfOpdQ) in low to moderate dimensions.

Useful for model calibration when a large number of sequential inversions are needed. 
  - **Sequential local approximate GPs**: Implementations of `slapGP` and `leapGP` which are two "global-model" extensions of the [laGP](https://www.jstatsoft.org/index.php/jss/article/view/v072i01/1030) framework. (Note: See [github.com/knrumsey/leapgp](https://www.github.com/knrumsey/leapgp) for a newer implementation.)
  - **Accelerated bootstrap**: An implementation of the accelerated bootstrap.
  - [**Joint credible regions**](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/361350/joint-credible-regions-from-mcmc-draws): Function to find elliptical joint credible regions given a sample of points $x \in \mathbb R^p$.
