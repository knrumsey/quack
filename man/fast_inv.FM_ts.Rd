\title{Fast Matrix Algebra for BMC}
\usage{
fast_inv.FM_ts(FM, phi = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{FM}{an object of class "FM_ts"}

\item{phi}{current value of phi (can be omitted if phi is stored in FM object)}
}
\value{
Returns an approximation of the inverse of the covariance matrix
}
\description{
Function for (approximately) computing the inverse of a BMC Covariance matrix.
Near-quadratic runtime leads to significant time-savings when covariance matrix is moderate to large.
}
\examples{
n <- 100
R <- GPfit::corr_matrix(seq(0,1,length.out=n), beta=0.2)
FM <- fast_process(R, method='approx', control=list(tol=1e-9))
#Compute determinant (approximately)
fast_det(FM, phi=1.5, tau=0.2)
#Compute inverse (approximately)
fast_inv(FM, phi=1.5, tau=0.2)
